# GPD-4303S-GUI
A GUI interface implemented with PyQt6 & PyVISA for remote digital control of the GW Instek GPD-X303S series of power supplies. Due to the limitations of the power supplies supplied driver if you intend to use the GUI which makes use of PyVISA & pyvisa-py modules for commuication, be sure to follow what the page for the GPD-X303S (https://www.gwinstek.com/en-global/products/detail/GPD-Series) tells you about the USB-Driver. From experience this USB driver will only work on a Windows 10 machine (and likely a windows Vista machine) that has the USB drivers installed.
