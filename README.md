# GPD-4303S-GUI
A GUI interface implemented with PyQt6 & PyVISA for remote digital control of the GW Instek GPD-X303S series of power supplies. Due to the limitations of the power supplies supplied driver if you intend to use the GUI which makes use of PyVISA & pyvisa-py modules for commuication, be sure to follow what the page for the GPD-X303S (https://www.gwinstek.com/en-global/products/detail/GPD-Series) tells you about the USB-Driver.

From experience the Windows USB driver paired with this program using Python 3.13.2 & PyQt 6.6.1 will work on a Windows 10 machine as this is what I developed this on. On the GW Instek product page for the GPD-X303S says the driver says there is support for Windows Vista, Vista can only use up to Python 3.7, as for PyQt6 support on Python 3.7 and below that would have be looked into if the need arises.
